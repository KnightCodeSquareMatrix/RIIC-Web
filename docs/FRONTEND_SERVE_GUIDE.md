# Frontend Serve Guide

The plan task worker keeps four isolated `infra-cli serve` processes alive, one per solver lane, instead of spawning a CLI process for every layout. The worker reuses the warmed first lane's verified capability for cache identity, while website health checks use a separate client in the web process. Each lane still owns at most one active request, so logs and protocol responses retain an unambiguous owner.

## Transport

Each solver lane starts its Worker with:

```bash
infra-cli serve
```

- stdin: one JSON request per line.
- stdout: mixed logs and NDJSON responses. A line is a response only when it is a JSON object whose `id` matches the active request and whose `ok` value is a boolean. Plain text, malformed JSON, JSON logs, unknown request IDs and response-shaped objects with a non-boolean `ok` remain stdout logs.
- stderr: logs only; never parse stderr as protocol output or copy stdout noise into it.

Each solver lane sends one request at a time so unstructured stage logs have an unambiguous owner. It preserves the raw stdout and stderr emitted during that request, including the final protocol response in stdout. Parsing accepts split chunks, partial lines, LF or CRLF, and a log plus response delivered in one chunk. Each stream is capped at 8 MiB; after overflow, the oldest content is removed, an explicit truncation marker is prepended, and the newest output is retained. A retry after Worker restart starts fresh stream captures, and late events from the old process are ignored.

## Capability gate

Before choosing a plan method, send:

```json
{"id":1,"method":"ping","params":{}}
```

The frontend uses `plan.compute` when `protocol_version` matches and `supported_plan_schema_versions` contains the website contract version:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "ok": true,
  "result": {
    "pong": true,
    "protocol_version": 1,
    "plan_schema_version": 4,
    "supported_plan_schema_versions": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "plan_contract_sha256": "<diagnostic-schema-fingerprint>",
    "solver_executable_sha256": "<running-executable-fingerprint>"
  }
}
```

`plan_contract_sha256` and `solver_executable_sha256` are diagnostic identities, not capability switches. In particular, LF and CRLF copies of the same schema may have different byte hashes without changing compatibility. Missing or different schema hashes therefore do not select the legacy route. A genuinely missing or mismatched `protocol_version`, or a supported-schema list that omits v3, keeps using the legacy `plan` method for runtime compatibility. `plan_schema_version` reports the Worker's current schema but does not override an explicit v3 entry in the supported list.

Capability negotiation is by membership: a Worker advertising `supported_plan_schema_versions: [1, 2, 3, 4]` still receives the website's v3 request. The website continues to send `fiammetta_enable`; it does not send the v4 `assert_invariants` option used by internal Check workflows.

Deployment health is intentionally stricter than runtime routing when `INFRA_CLI_EXPECTED_SHA256` is configured. In that mode the server pins CLI selection to the packaged platform binary in `bin/`, requires the current protocol plus v3 support, and requires the Worker fingerprint to match that artifact. A version or executable mismatch makes `plannerReady` false so the release runner rolls back; `INFRA_CLI_PATH` and a persisted active CLI cannot silently replace the verified artifact. Local or unmanaged environments may omit the expected hash, retain normal CLI candidate selection, and keep a legacy Worker available. The contract hash is recorded but never compared against a frontend constant.

Solver contract smoke tests require the private solver binary and are maintained outside this public repository. Public unit and E2E suites use fixtures and mock API responses; they do not download, execute, or depend on a solver artifact.

## `plan.compute` v1

The request contains the complete layout and operbox inline:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "method": "plan.compute",
  "params": {
    "schema_version": 3,
    "layout": {
      "template": "243",
      "drone_cap": 235,
      "scenario": {},
      "rooms": []
    },
    "operbox": [],
    "labels": {
      "layout": "243",
      "operbox": "Current Box"
    },
    "options": {
      "rotation": "abc_12_6_6",
      "top": 20,
      "system_preferences": {},
      "maa_title": "My schedule"
    }
  }
}
```

The actual request must contain 1–64 rooms and 1–1000 operators. Room IDs, operator IDs, and operator names must be non-empty and unique. Browser imports, Skland schedule snapshots, and restored v5 or migrated legacy sessions are normalized to one planner-facing record per operator name before the request is built. The public `/api/plan` boundary still rejects any remaining duplicate IDs or names instead of rewriting an arbitrary API payload.

Successful responses contain all outputs inline:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "ok": true,
  "elapsed_ms": 123,
  "result": {
    "schema_version": 3,
    "profile": {},
    "rotation": {
      "profile": "abc_12_6_6",
      "daily": {},
      "shifts": []
    },
    "maa": {},
    "training_room": {
      "schema_version": 1,
      "shifts": [
        { "trainee": "Operator A", "trainer": "Operator B" },
        { "trainee": null, "trainer": "Operator C" },
        { "trainee": null, "trainer": null }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The frontend validates `schema_version`, `profile`, `rotation.shifts`, and `maa` before marking the run successful. `training_room` is optional for compatibility with older Workers. When present, it must use schema version 1, contain exactly one entry per `maa.plans` shift, and provide both `trainee` and `trainer` as trimmed names or `null`. A name may not exceed 80 characters, occupy both training positions, or also appear in an explicit MAA room in the same shift. It then persists the inline profile and MAA values into the run directory so debug bundle paths always refer to real files.

Newer Workers may include `rotation.shifts[].assignment` and `rotation.shifts[].notes` in an otherwise valid v3 response. They are accepted as private transport details but are not part of the normalized public rotation DTO; schedule presentation and MAA export continue to use the normalized rotation and `maa` payload.

Error responses use the normal serve envelope:

```json
{"id":2,"ok":false,"elapsed_ms":3,"error":{"code":"PLAN_FAILED","stage":"plan.compute","message":"..."}}
```

## Legacy `plan`

Workers that do not pass the capability gate continue to receive path-based requests:

```json
{"id":3,"method":"plan","params":{"layout":"tmp/layout.json","operbox":"tmp/operbox.json","profile_out":"tmp/profile.json","maa_out":"tmp/maa.json","output_dir":"tmp/shifts","rotation":"abc_12_6_6","top":20,"maa_title":"My schedule"}}
```

All paths are selected by the frontend. After a successful response, the frontend reads `profile_out`, `maa_out`, and `team_shift_*.json` from the run directory.

## Lifecycle

1. Start and ping one Worker per solver lane before publishing the task worker's first heartbeat. The production task queue currently runs four lanes, and deployment readiness fails if any configured lane cannot start.
2. Cache that capability observation for the child-process generation, record its version and diagnostic fingerprints, and select `plan.compute` or legacy `plan` from the version fields only. A restarted child is pinged once before its next solve; healthy lanes are not pinged per task.
3. Write one request line and accept only a JSON object with the matching `id` and a boolean `ok`; retain the stdout/stderr text in that request's capped private capture.
4. Atomically persist one compact `run-envelope.json`. After the public result, cache ownership, business record, and task terminal state are durable, a two-slot background finalizer expands the request, response, per-request stdout/stderr, profile, MAA, result, and debug bundle once, then writes `artifact-expanded.json`. Database confirmation retries do not rewrite those files and continue at a slow interval after the initial retry budget. Malformed envelopes are quarantined immediately; an envelope whose run row is still missing after a ten-minute insertion grace period is quarantined as an orphan, and all retries stop at the private-record retention boundary. Startup resumes envelopes without a terminal `artifact-finalized.json` or `artifact-failed.json`; shutdown gives finalizers 30 seconds before leaving remaining envelopes for the next start.
5. If one lane's process exits while a request is active, restart that lane and retry the active request once.

## Public API boundary

The CLI response is an internal transport object. It must never be returned directly from a Next.js route handler.

`src/server/infra.ts` may retain CLI paths, commands, stdout, stderr, serve requests/responses, the ping observation and run-directory metadata for local diagnostics. Feedback looks up that exact private run by diagnostic ID and copies its solver observation into private `meta.json`; old or missing runs use `solver: null`. `src/server/public-plan.ts` is the required boundary before `/api/plan`: it constructs a new allowlisted DTO containing profile, MAA, rotation, duration, an opaque diagnostic ID and, when supplied by the current Worker, optional `trainingRoom` and `trainingAdvice` values parsed through their own strict public contracts. Training-room operators remain outside `maa.plans[*].rooms`, so MAA downloads never contain a training room or its occupants. Rotation is rebuilt through `src/rotation-result.ts`; only the selected profile, daily summary, normalized shifts, team state, weighted efficiency and normalized room efficiency are public. Raw `efficiencies`, assignments, solver identities and future unknown Worker or training fields are not forwarded in production.

The persisted `run-envelope.json`, `stdout.txt`, `stderr.txt`, `result.json` and `debug-bundle.json` are private diagnostic artifacts. Feedback links to the durable envelope while expansion is pending. Ordinary product API responses, plan history and browser persistence must not contain these logs. Log wording is not a stable protocol: frontend code must not infer Worker capability, progress or solver stage from log text.

The administrator issue-triage API is the deliberate, authenticated exception. `/api/admin/feedback`, `/api/admin/feedback/<id>`, `/api/admin/plan-runs`, and `/api/admin/plan-runs/<id>` require the current website administrator role and return non-cacheable responses. List responses contain only review summaries. Detail responses rebuild a reproduction allowlist containing the layout, normalized operator Box, rotation profile and count, Fiammetta state, error text, and at most 16 KiB from each retained output tail. They never return commands, filesystem paths, credentials, the raw debug bundle, or unknown artifact fields. Feedback mutations require a same-origin request and are rate-limited; one bulk deletion accepts at most 100 feedback IDs and does not delete the linked plan run. Product pages do not call these administrator endpoints.

The server appends diagnostic values under `data.debug` only when `BETA_DEBUG_TOOLS_ENABLED=1` and that `/api/plan` request explicitly carries `?beta=1`. The query parameter cannot override a disabled server switch or the production deployment policy, while an ordinary development request remains limited to the core allowlist plus the two optional training fields even when the server switch is enabled. Public contract tests recursively reject internal field names in production responses, and the v5 browser persistence layer strips `data.debug` even in a debug session.

Do not extend the public DTO by spreading an internal result:

```ts
// Incorrect: leaks new internal fields automatically.
return NextResponse.json({ success: true, data: { ...internalResult } });

// Correct: construct the allowlist through the boundary mapper.
return successResponse(toPublicPlanData(internalResult, labels, requestId), requestId);
```

### Persistent task admission

Authenticated `POST /api/tasks` requests persist an encrypted task payload before returning. Cache lookup is one immediate read and never waits for another request's fill lease. An admitted task returns a deterministic queue position and an ETA derived from the four solver lanes plus the Worker's recent service-time EWMA:

```json
{"success":true,"data":{"taskId":"<opaque-id>","status":"pending","queuePosition":12,"etaSeconds":9}}
```

When the 1,000-task global activity limit or the 600-new-account activity limit is full, an otherwise eligible task enters the bounded candidate ring instead:

```json
{"success":true,"data":{"taskId":"<opaque-id>","status":"buffered","selectionPoolSize":37}}
```

`GET /api/tasks/<taskId>` returns the same `pending` or `buffered` state until the task is running or terminal. Its hot query projects only public status/result columns and never reads the encrypted request envelope. `selectionPoolSize` is the current candidate-ring size, not a queue position: capacity releases promote one eligible candidate at random. Clients use jittered status-aware polling (1 s running, 2–15 s pending, 30 s buffered) and must not resubmit while that task is reserved.

Admission failures use both the standard `Retry-After` response header and `error.retryAfterSeconds` in the JSON envelope:

- `AIC-PLAN-3005`: the account already owns a buffered, pending, or running task; wait for that task to finish or cancel it.
- `AIC-PLAN-3006`: the account reached 10 starts in 10 minutes.
- `AIC-PLAN-3007`: the network reached either 100 active accounts or 200 starts in 10 minutes.
- `AIC-PLAN-3008`: the 2,000-task candidate ring is full.

Network failures back off from 2 to 32 seconds, then pause with a manual “query progress” action; healthy long waits continue using the status-aware intervals above. Retry buttons remain disabled for the server-provided countdown.
